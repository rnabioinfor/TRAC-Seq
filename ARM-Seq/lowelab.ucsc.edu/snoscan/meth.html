<h1>Snoscan Methylation File Format</h1>

<P>
A methylation file can be created for each target RNA sequence
(i.e. rRNAs) to specify the positions
that are known or expected to be 2'-O-ribose methylated.  These sites are usually based on
biochemical evidence, or inferred from related species with
reliable methylation site data.  
<P> 
The basic format for a methylaiton file is
<PRE>
>Target-seq-name1
N  Number  "My comment"
</PRE>


Where:<BR>
"Target-seq-name1" MUST match the name of the sequence in the target
sequence FASTA file,<BR>
"N" is A,C,G, or T  and must match the letter at that position in the
target sequence,<BR>
"Optional comment" is any free text up to 60 characters (i.e. "Site
modified by U14").  <BR>
Whitespace characters (tab, single or multiple spaces) separates these three fields.
<P>
Multiple methylation sites for multiple sequences can be specified in one file,
and do not need to appear in the same order as in the target sequence
FASTA file (but the sequence names MUST match).  Also, you do NOT need
to supply methylation information for each target sequence, just those
you have data for.
<P>
For example, if you submitted this FASTA target sequence to the server:
<PRE>
>My-seq-A  small subunit ribosomal sequence from my favorite organism
TATCTGGTTGATCCTGCCAGTAGTCATATGCTTGTCTCAAAGATTAAGCC
ATGCATGTCTAAGTATAAGCAATTTATACAGTGAA
>My-seq-B  large subunit ribosomal sequence from my favorite organism
GATGTATTTATTAGATAAAAAATCAATGTCTTCGGACTCTTTG
</PRE>
Then the methylation file specifying sites in these target sequences
might look like:
<PRE>
>My-seq-A
T 5   Verified meth site by TML
C 12  Predicted by snoscan
A 51  Known target of U21
>My-seq-B
G 1   Partially modified site
A 6   Mapped by Maden
</PRE>
See the sample yeast and human methylation site files on the main
search page for more examples.
